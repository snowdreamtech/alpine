# Docker Entrypoint Wrapper
# Purpose: Orchestrates container initialization by executing scripts in entrypoint.d.
# Usage: This script is the default ENTRYPOINT. It iterates over entrypoint.d/ and then
# hands over control to the specific commands via exec (replacing PID 1).
# Dependencies: Requires /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.d directory.
# Design:
#   - POSIX compliant for maximum portability across Alpine/Debian/etc.
#   - Supports DEBUG=true for verbose initialization logging.
#   - Employs 'exec' to ensure graceful shutdown signal forwarding.
