# Makefile Commands

All common tasks are unified under `make`. Run `make help` to see all available targets.

## Setup & Installation

```bash
make setup    # Install system-level tools (Homebrew/APT/Scoop depending on OS)
make install  # Install project language dependencies
```

## Quality Gates

```bash
make lint     # Run ALL linting checks (pre-commit hooks)
make format   # Auto-format code across all languages
make test     # Run the test suite
make check    # Run lint + test in sequence
```

## Build & Release

```bash
make build    # Build the project binary/artifacts
make clean    # Remove build artifacts and temporary files
```

## Cross-Platform Behavior

The Makefile automatically detects your operating system and uses the appropriate package manager:

| OS                    | Package Manager   |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| macOS                 | Homebrew (`brew`) |
| Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) | APT (`apt-get`)   |
| Linux (RedHat/Alpine) | DNF/APK           |
| Windows               | Scoop or Winget   |
