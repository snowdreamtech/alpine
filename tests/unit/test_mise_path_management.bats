# Bug Condition Exploration Test for Mise Tools PATH Management
# Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
#
# CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
# DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails
# NOTE: This test encodes the expected behavior - it will validate the fix when it passes after implementation
# GOAL: Surface counterexamples that demonstrate the bug exists
#
# Property 1: Bug Condition - Automatic PATH Management After Mise Install
# Scoped PBT Approach: Scope the property to specific scenario where:
# - mise shims are NOT in current session PATH
# - run_mise install succeeds (exit code 0)
# - resolve_bin is called immediately after
#
# Expected Behavior: After successful run_mise install, the tool should be
# immediately resolvable via resolve_bin without manual PATH manipulation
