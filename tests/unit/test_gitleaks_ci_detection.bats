# Bug Condition Exploration Test for CI Gitleaks Detection
# **Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4**
#
# **CRITICAL**: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
# **DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails**
# **NOTE**: This test encodes the expected behavior - it will validate the fix when it passes after implementation
# **GOAL**: Surface counterexamples that demonstrate the bug exists
#
# **Property 1: Bug Condition** - Gitleaks Not Found After Installation
# Scoped PBT Approach: Scope the property to CI environment where mise cache is disabled and mise shims are not in PATH
#
# **TEST RESULT ANALYSIS**:
# This test PASSED UNEXPECTEDLY in local development environment.
# This indicates:
#   1. The bug is CI-specific and does NOT reproduce locally
#   2. Local environment has mise shims already in PATH, preventing bug reproduction
#   3. The bug likely requires a truly fresh CI runner environment to manifest
#
# **RECOMMENDATION**: This test serves as a regression test for the fix, but cannot
# validate the bug exists on unfixed code in local development. The bug must be
# validated in actual CI environment (GitHub Actions).
