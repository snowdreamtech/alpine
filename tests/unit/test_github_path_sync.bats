# Bug Condition Exploration Test for GitHub PATH Same-Step Sync
# Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
#
# **Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4**
#
# CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
# DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails
# NOTE: This test encodes the expected behavior - it will validate the fix when it passes after implementation
# GOAL: Surface counterexamples that demonstrate the bug exists
#
# Property 1: Bug Condition - CI environment same-step PATH synchronization
# Scoped PBT Approach: Scope the property to specific failing scenario where:
# - CI environment (GITHUB_PATH is set)
# - run_mise install succeeds and writes to GITHUB_PATH file
# - Current shell PATH does NOT contain the tool path (BUG)
# - resolve_bin cannot find the tool immediately (BUG)
#
# Expected Behavior (after fix): After successful run_mise install in CI,
# the tool path should be:
# 1. Written to GITHUB_PATH file (for cross-step persistence)
# 2. Added to current shell PATH (for same-step availability)
# 3. Immediately resolvable via resolve_bin
